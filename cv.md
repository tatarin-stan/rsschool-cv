### About me:
I study at Kharkov Aviation Institute On the specialty computer science. Master's degree. One year and I graduate from the institute. And that's why I'm here. Interest in programming appeared in college. In my 2nd year of college I tried to teach Web (HTML, css),after a while I lost interest and I abandoned this idea. But now I understand that I will soon graduate from the institute and I need to go to work. So in the winter I went on the move on the front end (Actually, the move was a full stack). In the courses I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS. a bit of git, Node.js, figma…… and had to learn REact, but the war started.. So I decided to try again and go all the way.

### Skills:
+ HTML, CSS, JS
+ Git & GitHub 
+ WebStorm, VSCode, SublimeT
+ Figma

### Code example:
Hollow square star pattern with diagonal
``` js
function Xfigure(){

let n = 4;
let m = 2*n-1;
let str = '';
let star = '*';
    for(let i=1;i<=m;i++)
    {
        for(let j=1;j<=m;j++)
        {
            if(i==j || j==(m-i+1))
            {
                str = str + star;
            }
            else
            {
                str = str + "  ";
            }
        }
        str = str + "\n";
}
    return str;
} 
```
